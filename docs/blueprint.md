# **App Name**: CourtSide Chronicle

## Core Features:

- Live Score Tracking: Fetch and parse live match data from a Google Sheets URL that the user can configure. Display current scores, set scores, and final scores for ongoing matches.
- Group Standings Display: Display tournament standings (tables) for the two groups, automatically updated based on match results. The user can configure the teams in the two groups.
- Timeout Alert Modal: Implement a button that triggers a modal to display team timeout information for 30 seconds. This will be triggered manually.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent the energy and excitement of volleyball.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent: Orange (#FF9933) for interactive elements like the timeout button and score highlights.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize match scores, group standings, and the timeout button.  Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Employ simple, recognizable icons for match status (live, finished, upcoming) and team names.
- Incorporate subtle animations for score updates and modal transitions to provide visual feedback.
